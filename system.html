      <h1>Scum & Villainy</h1>
      <p>A Forged in the Dark Game</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>S&V uses a 6-sided dice system. You roll several at once and read the single highest result (yay! no adding necessary).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the highest die is a <strong>6</strong>, it’s a full success—things go well. If you roll more than one 6, it’s a critical success—you gain some additional advantage.</li>
      <li>If the highest die is a <strong>4/5</strong>, that’s a partial success—you do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences—trouble, harm, reduced effect, etc.</li>
      <li>If the highest die is <strong>1-3</strong>, it’s a bad outcome. Things go poorly. You likely don’t achieve your goal and you suffer complications, too.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rolls when you have zero dice are rolls at disadvantage (roll 2 dice, take the lower). You can't roll a critical when you have zero dice.</p>
    <p>There are 5 types of rolls that you'll use most often in the game:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Action Roll</strong>. When a PC attempts an action that&rsquo;s dangerous or troublesome, you make an action roll to find out how it goes. Action rolls and their effects and consequences drive most of the game.</li>
      <li><strong>Downtime Roll</strong>. When the PCs are at their leisure after a job, they can perform downtime activities in relative safety. You make downtime rolls to see how much they get done.</li>
      <li><strong>Engagement Roll</strong>. The engagement roll is made at the beginning of each job. It helps jump past the planning, and showcases what position the PCs are in when the twists and complications of the job hit them.</li>
      <li><strong>Fortune Roll. </strong>The GM can make a fortune roll to disclaim decision making and leave something up to chance. How loyal is an NPC? How much does the bounty hunter find out? How valuable is the information on those Guild
        drives?</li>
      <li><strong>Resistance Roll. </strong>A player can make a resistance roll when their character suffers a consequence they don&rsquo;t like. The roll tells us how much stress their character suffers to reduce the severity of a consequence. When
        you resist that &ldquo;Broken Leg&rdquo; harm, you take some stress and now it&rsquo;s only a &ldquo;Sprained Ankle&rdquo; instead.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Last mechanic is the flashback mechanic. During a job, you can ask for a flashback to do something that will help you in the present. This will cost you stress depending how easy or complicated the flashback will be.</p>

    <h2>Characters &amp; Playbooks</h2>
    <p>There are 7 playbooks you can pick from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mechanic </strong>- Play a Mechanic if you want to make new devices, keep your ship in good shape, or hack systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Muscle </strong>- Muscles are good at winning fights. Play a Muscle if you want to be unstoppable in combat.</li>
      <li><strong>Mystic </strong>- Mystics are good at dealing with the Way*. Play one if you want to use artifacts and weird powers.</li>
      <li><strong>Pilot </strong>- Play a Pilot if you want to be a daredevil at the wheel and widely traveled.</li>
      <li><strong>Scoundrel </strong>- Scoundrels love getting into and out of trouble. Play a Scoundrel if you want to press your luck.</li>
      <li><strong>Speaker </strong>- Play a Speaker if you want to be the respectable one and use connections to get your way.</li>
      <li><strong>Stitch </strong>- Play a Stitch to deal with science, patch people up, and be the crew's moral compass.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note: The Way is S&amp;V's, serial numbers filed off, version of the Force.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Heritage</strong></p>
    <p>There are no set races in Scum and Villainy, so instead you pick a heritage, which determines your birth and upbringing. The options are Imperial, Spacer, Colonist, Manufactured, Wanderer, or Xeno. Based on your heritage, you pick an ability
      score to add a dice to, so this part is quite open to interpretation.</p>
    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
    <p>While your heritage determines how you were raised, your background determines what you've been up to before joining the crew.&nbsp; Same as heritage, you determine the skill you gained. Your options are Academic, Labor, Cult, Guilder,
      Military, Noble, Syndicate.</p>
    <p><strong>Relationships</strong></p>
    <p>Each of the playbooks have preset NPC friends. You may choose to disregard these and come up with people you may know. One of them is your friend and one is your rival.</p>
    <p><strong>XP Triggers</strong></p>
    <p>So there are triggers listed in each of the playbooks that give you xp. They are quite superficial so I'm gonna implement the Belief system [from the veil] which feels a bit more fun. Each character has three actionable beliefs, which says how
      they interact with the world. If a Belief is tested this session, mark 1 XP at the end of the session. If a Belief gets you into trouble this session, mark 2 XP at the end of the session. If a Belief is erased and resolved or changed after
      being tested, mark 3 XP</p>
    <p><strong>Xeno</strong></p>
    <p>Every playbook comes with a starting ability. If you want to play a xeno, ie an alien, you can choose to instead have a xeno ability. Let me know so I can start planning around your heritage.</p>
