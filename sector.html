					<h2>Atlas System</h2>
					<p class="synopsis">Located at the center of the sector, Atlas system is headquarters to the Alliance. Revolving around a man-made star, <strong>Luxx</strong>, the system is a shining beacon of Capitalism and is the hub for all in and out of
						sector trading. Galactic law is more present here than the rest of the sector, as this is the seat of the sector's administration and contains gates to the three systems, including a path towards the rest of the Hegemony.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sys_places">
					<h3>Notable Places</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Luxx</strong>
							<p>A completely man-made star, Luxx is feat of scientific discovery, created by the College of Synergetics, and fully funded by The Alliance. The star's creation allowed nearby land masses to be sucked into orbit, allowing the Alliance
								full control over their new heart of the sector.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Andora</strong>
							<p>New and fresh, Andora is an upscale restaurant and bar, catering to the rich and famous. Located on Meridian, the founder and owner, Morgan Law, found a way to utilize the planet's strange orbit in a makeshift art piece.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Delta Station</strong>
							<p>The center for shipping and travel in the sector, the station acts as a central refueling and resting location in the sector for Alliance-authorized ships. The station also acts as a customs checkpoint as all goods coming in, out, and
								through the Sector must stop here first.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Auberon</strong>
							<p>Destroyed in the Rebellion of 1110, the gate connected the old System of Castor to the rest of the sector. It is known that during the Calamity, all the planets where destroyed and abandoned.</p>

					<h3>Notable Places</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Obsidian Correctional Center</strong>
							<p>Orbiting near the star, Obsidian is the largest prison in Gamma Sector. Wardens broker audiences with prisoners and grant commutations for the powerful and wealthy.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Avalon</strong>
							<p>In the deep space of near Calypso live the pirates of the high tide. The area is known for forming wormholes which makes catching up with wealthy merchant ships a breeze.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>High Winds</strong>
							<p>The rings around Astrea produce a region between them where engines have more thrust, akin to “winds” of a planet. The path is hard to find and switches direction. Pilots in the know use this to gain an advantage on rush deliveries (or daring escapes).</p>

					<h2>Erax System</h2>
					<p class="synopsis">Storms, ice, lava, winds, the planets in Erax are harsh and unexplored. Along with the unpredictable <strong>Tartarus</strong>, the system is known for its high risk and high reward. Many metals and minerals are found here in Erax system, however extracting them can be quite dangerous. The danger of the system, results in there being a higher concentration of undisturbed Precursor artifacts and a higher concentration of Way energy.
				</div>
				<div class="sys_places">
					<h3>Notable Places</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Anomaly</strong>
							<p>What appears as a mountain of scrap metal piled up, Anomaly is actually a base made up of a hundred or more ships, docked together. The Anomaly is a Way-user base coordinated and run by an unknown benefactor and its design renders it untouchable by Hegemonic factions.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Serenity Research Institute</strong>
							<p>A Scientific Research station owned by College of Synergetics located at the southern pole of The Ruptured Planet, remote from Asphodel and interfacing with the small city only when researchers need to leave the planet.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tartarus</strong>
							<p>This area of space is best avoided by those traveling in the sector as the erratic magnetic fields surrounding the area affect ship systems. Many ships have been lost and never found again in the vast space of Tartarus, and the area has been condemned by Delta Corp & The Alliance.</p>

					<h2>Myre System</h2>
					<p class="synopsis">The first system to be discovered in the sector, the system revolves around a small red dwarf star, Myre. The system has no habitable terrestrial planets, but it's largest gas giant <strong>Novix</strong>, has two inhabited moons. The system, while generally unappealing, was brought into the Alliance for their valuable metals that can be found.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sys_places">
					<h3>Notable Places</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Shipyards</strong>
							<p>While the primary yard is run by Delta Corp, many smaller, licensed hubs work on repairs and ship refits. These stations are  full of bored spacers looking for any distraction from the wait. Delta sometimes hire foolhardy pilots for prototype tests.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Barnard's Star</strong>
							<p>The average spacer's pub and bar, Barnard's Star is populated with miners and spacers looking for a drink and some company. The pub is usually found orbiting around Quagmire, though it occasionally moves to other planets and moons in the system.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Eternium</strong>
							<p>This large gas giant, while impossible for life, holds the key to the system's survival. The large planet shields colonies from an asteroid field which crosses every few decades. When this happens, small pieces are scattered through this solar system, but the vast majority are caught by Eternium.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>The Tart</strong>
							<p>A seedy but thriving underground market, known for their criminal presence. Military involvement is lax and people keep to themselves which makes this the place to be for dangerous jobs and bounties. The homebase for The Underground, a criminal radio network that acts as a hub for all unseedy sector news.</p>
